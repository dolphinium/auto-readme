# Auto-Readme

> Most of the parts of this README file is generated by this project.

Auto-Readme is a tool designed to automate the process of generating README files for your projects. It scans through your codebase, summarizes important files, and gathers information about dependencies, offering a concise overview of the project.



## Project Overview

The main functionality of Auto-Readme is encapsulated in the `main.py` script. It performs the following tasks:

- **Summarize Code Files:** The script walks through the project directory, identifies code files with specific extensions (`.py`, `.js`, `.java`, `.cpp`, `.md`), and generates a summary for each file. It skips the `README.md` file to prevent redundancy.
  
  ```python
  def summarize_code_files():
      summaries = ""
      for root, _, files in os.walk('.'):
          for file in files:
              if file.endswith(('.py', '.js', '.java', '.cpp', '.md')) and file != 'README.md':
                  file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                  summary = summarize_code(file_path)
                  summaries += summary + "\n\n"
      return summaries
  ```

- **Get Dependencies:** This function checks for the presence of a `requirements.txt` file for Python projects or a `package.json` file for Node.js projects, and extracts the list of dependencies.

  ```python
  def get_dependencies():
      dependencies = ""
      if os.path.exists('requirements.txt'):
          with open('requirements.txt', 'r') as file:
              dependencies = file.read()
      elif os.path.exists('package.json'):
          import json
          with open('package.json', 'r') as file:
              ...
  ```

## Usage Examples

To use Auto-Readme, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd auto-readme
   ```

2. **Install Required Python Packages:**

   Ensure you have openai installed in your environment.
   ```bash
   pip install openai
   ```

   Also make sure you have a OPENAI api key in your environment variables.
   For MacOS:
    ```bash
    echo "export OPENAI_API_KEY='yourkey'" >> ~/.zshrc
    ```

    ```bash
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```

3. **Run the Main Script:**

   Execute the `main.py` script to generate summaries of your code files and extract dependencies:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **View Generated Summaries:**

   The script will output summaries of code files and list the dependencies found in your project. You can use this information to draft your README.md file.

Auto-Readme simplifies the task of documenting projects, making it easier for developers to maintain clear and informative documentation. Whether you are starting from scratch or updating an existing project, Auto-Readme provides a helpful starting point for your README needs.
